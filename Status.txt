Modules fully refactored:
  - Lists
  - Game
  - GameTree
  - Normal
  - Exec

Modules TODO:
  - merge Selectors and Strategy into a single Strategy module
  - merge all iterated stuff into a single module
  - merge some constructors for incrementally building game trees 
    from Extensive into GameTree and cut the rest?
